# Disease-Symptom Prediction

In today's data-driven world, the quest for enhancing healthcare outcomes has never been more critical. One of the most promising frontiers in this pursuit is the development of disease prediction models. These models hold the power to revolutionize patient care, offering early detection, personalized treatment, and ultimately, improved quality of life.

This disease prediction model that takes in some symptoms and predicts a disease, gives a description and some precautions to take. 


## Datasets
I got suitable data from kaggle for the symptoms and their diseases, a description and precautions. 

## **Steps**
- Data exploration
- Data transformation
- Model building, optimizing and saving
- Uploading on the web using Streamlit

[sympt.ipynb]() contains the codes for analysis

[app.py]() contains the codes to deploy on Stramlit

The following libraries were used;
- Pandas for data loading and analysis
- Matplotlib for visualizations
- Plotly for visualizations
- Numpy for mathematical inputations
- Sklearn for model building
- Tensorflow for deep learning model building 
- Streamlit for web app building
